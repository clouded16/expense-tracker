# Day 07 — Structured Data & Safe Errors

## What I worked on
- Created input and response data models
- Added POST and GET expense endpoints
- Used FastAPI automatic validation
- Intentionally triggered input and output errors

## What I learned
- Data models prevent logic errors
- FastAPI blocks invalid requests before logic runs
- Response models protect users from bad server output

## What worked well
- Testing via /docs
- Seeing clear validation error messages

## What confused me
- Response models initially felt abstract

## Key takeaway
- Errors are alert signals that guide fixes

## Next step
- Introduce database storage carefully
