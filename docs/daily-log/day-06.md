# Day 06 — First Backend Server

## What I worked on
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Installed FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Created first backend server
- Ran server locally and verified response

## What I learned
- Backend servers are just programs that listen and respond
- FastAPI automatically generates API documentation
- Errors are readable and not scary

## What worked well
- Step-by-step approach reduced anxiety
- Running the server locally felt safe
- Automatic docs helped understanding

## What confused me
- (Write “nothing” if nothing confused you)

## Questions or doubts
- (Any questions to revisit later)

## Next step
- Create a new endpoint that accepts structured data (Day 7)
