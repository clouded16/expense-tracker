# Day 17 – AI as a Coach (Language Layer)

## What was built
- AI rephrasing service (mocked)
- Integration of AI layer after personalization
- Tone-aware message rewriting
- Unified coaching feed with human-friendly language

## Key decisions
- AI restricted to language only
- No AI access to raw financial data
- No AI influence on logic or decisions

## What I learned
- How to use AI responsibly in financial systems
- Why explainability matters more than automation
- How clean layering prevents AI misuse

## Status
Day 17 completed successfully. System now communicates like a coach without compromising safety or trust.
