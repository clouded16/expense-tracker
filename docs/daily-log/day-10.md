# Day 10 – Goal Feasibility Analysis

## What was built
- Introduced services layer
- Implemented feasibility analysis engine
- Deterministic logic based on expenses + goals
- Human-readable coaching output
- Tested logic independently from API and DB

## Key decisions
- No AI for decision-making
- Feasibility treated as derived data
- Pure functions with explicit inputs
- Policy-based thresholds for classification

## What I learned
- How to separate reasoning from infrastructure
- Why explainability matters in financial systems
- How goals transform raw data into coaching insights

## Status
Day 10 completed successfully. System can now reason about goals.
