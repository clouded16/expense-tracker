# Day 15 – Feedback Loop & Learning

## What was built
- Feedback ORM model
- Feedback API model
- POST /feedback endpoint
- Persistent storage of user responses to insights

## Key decisions
- Feedback stored as signals, not full insight data
- No immediate logic changes based on feedback
- Learning designed as an overlay, not core logic

## What I learned
- Why adaptive systems need explicit user signals
- How to enable personalization without AI decisions
- How feedback improves trust and relevance

## Status
Day 15 completed successfully. System can now learn from user behavior.
